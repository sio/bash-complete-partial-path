# Enhanced file path completion in bash

This project adds incomplete file path expansion to bash (the feature that was
originally unique to zsh).

When the Tab key is pressed bash expands only the last piece of the path by
default, but with the completion functions from this project it will assume any
of path elements might be incomplete. For example: `cd /u/s/app<Tab>` will
produce nothing by default, but will be expanded to `cd /usr/share/applications`
if you've configured bash to load this file.

Introductory overview is available at
[author's blog](https://potyarkin.ml/posts/2018/enhanced-file-path-completion-in-bash-like-in-zsh/).

Watch a demo screencast to see this feature in action:
[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/0zhzOYbkF22pWLmbx1RHCYyqQ.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/0zhzOYbkF22pWLmbx1RHCYyqQ)

To enable the described behavior source [**this file**][main] from your
~/.bashrc and run `_bcpp --defaults`. Supported features are:

- Special characters in completed path are automatically escaped if present
- Tilde expressions are properly expanded (as per [bash documentation])
- If user had started writing the path in quotes, no character escaping is
  applied. Instead the quote is closed with a matching character after expanding
  the path.
- If [bash-completion] package is already in use, this code will safely override
  its `_filedir` function. No extra configuration is required, just make sure
  you source this project *after* the main bash-completion.

Completion functions have been tested and reported to work on:

- Linux (Debian 9)
- macOS (requires gnu-sed from brew)
- Windows (MSYS)


## Installation and updating

First you need to copy [bash_completion][main] file to your machine.  Copy and
paste the following commands into your terminal to fetch the latest version of
the script to the default location (requires `curl` to be installed).

```shell
# Install or update bash-complete-partial-path
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/bash-complete-partial-path/" && \
curl \
 -o "$HOME/.config/bash-complete-partial-path/bash_completion" \
 "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sio/bash-complete-partial-path/master/bash_completion"
```

To enable the new completion behavior put the following lines into your
`~/.bashrc` (or your OS equivalent).

```shell
# Enhanced file path completion in bash - https://github.com/sio/bash-complete-partial-path
if [ -s "$HOME/.config/bash-complete-partial-path/bash_completion" ]
then
    source "$HOME/.config/bash-complete-partial-path/bash_completion"
    _bcpp --defaults
fi
```

Make sure you source this project *after* the main bash-completion which may be
included in your  `~/.bashrc` file.

## Custom feature selection

If you like the project idea overall but do not agree with default behavior,
you can select which features to enable with `_bcpp` manager function. Sourcing
the file without calling this function has no side effects.

```
Usage: _bcpp OPTIONS
    Manage enhanced path completion in bash

Options:
    --defaults
        Enable the subset of features recommended by maintainer.
        Currently equals to:
        "--files --dirs --override --nocase --readline"
    --all
        Enable all optional features. Equals to:
        "--files --dirs --override --nocase --readline"
    --help
        Show this help message

Individual feature flags:
    --files
        Enable enhanced completion for file paths
    --dirs
        Complete `cd` with paths to directories only
    --override
        Override bash-completion if it's in use
    --nocase
        Make path completion case insensitive
    --readline
        Configure readline for better user experience. Equals to:
        "--readline-menu --readline-color --readline-misc"
    --readline-color
        Enable colors in completion
    --readline-menu
        Use `menu-complete` when TAB key is pressed instead of default
        `complete`
    --readline-misc
        Other useful readline tweaks
```


## Contributing

Thank you for taking an interest in this project! If you wish to improve it
please open an issue or create a pull request.

Your help is most needed in the following areas:

- Documenting the project
- Finding (and fixing) existing bugs
- Testing the script on other operating systems and reporting the results (both
  positive and negative)
- Expanding OS support (if it's lacking)
- Adding better demo asciicasts and screenshots

The project was created to do one thing (autocomplete partial paths) and to do
it well. Please try to keep all code in one file and to keep it short. Major new
functionality is probably better suited for a separate project.

I'm open to dialog and I promise to behave responsibly and treat all
contributors with respect. Please try to do the same, and treat others the way
you want to be treated.

Thank you again!
