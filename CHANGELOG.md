## v1.0.0 (2019-12-04)

The project has been around for a long time, but no formal releases were
made. From now on the project will follow semantic versioning convention.

Current release of bash-complete-partial-path is considered stable and all users
are recommended to upgrade to this version.

All desired functionality is implemented and has been in use for more than a
year on several platforms. Automated tests and CI were added recently to
detect regressions and to monitor compatibility with all supported platforms.
